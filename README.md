DataVitz Portfolio Project

Overview
DataVitz is an interactive data visualization portfolio project that showcases various data insights through user-friendly interfaces. This project is built using modern web development tools and technologies, aiming to provide an engaging and dynamic experience for end-users.

Inspiration
The inspiration for DataVitz came from my fascination with data and how it can be transformed into meaningful insights. I noticed that while there are many complex datasets available, few platforms present this data in an engaging and accessible manner. This motivated me to create a project that would not only visualize data but also tell a story, making it easier for users to grasp insights at a glance.

Technical Challenges
One of the primary challenges I faced was deciding on the best visualization libraries to use. After researching various options, I chose Chart.js for its simplicity and powerful features, allowing for responsive and interactive charts. Implementing the JavaScript logic for dynamically updating the visualizations based on user input was also challenging, but ultimately rewarding.
